# Give Me Some Credit
This project is a fantastic solution of the classic Kaggle competition using the data set [Give Me Some Credit](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit/data). 
The report and poster are attached.

## Overview
The goal of this competition is to build a model that borrowers can use to help make the best financial decisions(improve on the state of the art in credit scoring by predicting the probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years). I compared different models and chose a best one for this competition. From this project, I get an intuition of what Machine Learning is.

## Structure
Like other machine learning tasks, this project includes Data Preprocessing, Dataset Analysis, Model-building and Optimization. A discussion of oversampling and downsampling is also included in this project.
